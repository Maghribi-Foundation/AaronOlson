# Homework 1 
## My Best/Worst Case Scenarios for the Semester

### Instructions: 
By focusing on a group project, this class has a spectrum of different outcomes that are out of your control. If the group project is not successful, you will need to have a backup plan of making an individual project. 
Write up ≈1 page visualizing what your personal best-case outcome is for the semester and the worst case. Delete or adapt the following template. For best case, discuss your dream project and why you are interested in that subject
If you want the group to see your ideas, please submit this homework assignment to your personal GitHub repo under the ICS 690 repo. If you want these ideas to stay private, email this assignment to craig.calcaterra@metrostate.edu

## Best Case
The DApp built is for a chit fund type of network on the EVM. We will probably want to start with ethereum since there are a lot of libraries and tutorials availbel for Ethereum specifically. It is valuable because it will serve as the building blocks for a DAO that handles a reputation token scheme among anonymous members using smart contracts. The logic will include handling the group membership and reputation distribution. We may even decide to issue our own token to use for reputation, which would be a useful thing to understand and experience. If the project is done well and we can come up with a novel approach to either reputation tokens or the idea of anonymous chit funds, the project could become a valuable artifact in the open source dapp space. We could get some part-time work as consultants or through grants  implementing our solution on other EVM based blockchains. The record of my GitHub commits is proof of my experience and reputation as a software developer. I use that reputation and experience to contribute to other solidity based projects in the future. The experience is also valuable to me to be able to better understand and evaluate the current and future technology landscape that is based around the concepts developed in this class and on this project. I want to learn how smart contracts work and to understand the problems currently facing these technologies on a deeper level. Through all of this I am able to get an A in the class.

## Worst Case
The group project fails, so I must work on an individual project. Minimally, I’m expected to copy a tutorial and adapt it to finish my own personal DApp. In that case I have decided to still work on a chit fund DApp, because I have already already started doing the research, found some prior art, and I think I can do it, if maybe not as well as with a group, by myself. I finish the DApp and publish it on my personal repository on GitHub. It compiles, proving my project works. I write up a presentation explaining what I did and present it at the end of the semester and I get an A in the class. I use this record of my GitHub commits as proof of my reputation as a software developer to possibly make some contributions to some more serious/established blockchain/dapp projects. This experience is still valuable. Even in this worst case I am still able to accomplish many of the goals I laid out in my best case. The project may or may not have novel applications, but it would still be useful to other devs who follow this path in the future (since it will be open source) and will constitute another piece of prior art. 

## Worst Worst Case Scenario
The group project fails and I fail to budget enough time or run into many unforeseen technical roadblocks and I am unable to finish my personal DApp. Hopefully I am still able to accomplish some things and those things are valuable learning experiences.  I will present what I was able to accomplish as well as what issues I ran into. Hopefully this experience can be useful in the future. Hopefully I am still able to accomplish most of my goals from my best case, at least as far as learning about the technology is concerned.
